Zero,NLCDcode = 0;  Not sure what this means yet.  Not in the metadata.  Probably means missing value.
Water,"NLCDcode = 11;  Open Water - All areas of open water, generally with less than 25% cover or vegetation or soil"
IceSnow,"NLCDcode = 12;  Perennial Ice/Snow - All areas characterized by a perennial cover of ice and/or snow, generally greater than 25% of total cover."
DevOpen,"NLCDcode = 21;  Developed, Open Space - Includes areas with a mixture of some constructed materials, but mostly vegetation in the form of lawn grasses.  Impervious surfaces account for less than 20 percent of total cover.  These areas most commonly include large-lot single-family housing units, parks, golf courses, and vegetation planted in developed settings for recreation, erosion control, or aesthetic purposes."
DevLow,"NLCDcode = 22;  Developed, Low Intensity -Includes areas with a mixture of constructed materials and vegetation.  Impervious surfaces account for 20-49 percent of total cover.  These areas most commonly include single-family housing units."

Grass,"NLCDcode = 71;  Grassland/Herbaceous - Areas dominated by grammanoid or herbaceous vegetation, generally greater than 80% of total vegetation.  These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling, but can be utilized for grazing."
Pasture,"NLCDcode = 81;  Pasture/Hay - Areas of grasses, legumes, or grass-legume mixtures planted for livestock grazing or the production of seed or hay crops, typically on a perennial cycle. Pasture/hay vegetation accounts for greater than 20 percent of total vegetation."
Crops,"NLCDcode = 82;  Cultivated Crops - Areas used for the production of annual crops, such as corn, soybeans, vegetables, tobacco, and cotton, and also perennial woody crops such as orchards and vineyards. Crop vegetation accounts for greater than 20 percent of total vegetation. This class also includes all land being actively tilled."
